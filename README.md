# RMC - React Material Components

ðŸ’¥ **Note:** This library is still under development; you should continue to use [RMWC](https://github.com/jamesmfriedman/rmwc) until v1 is released 

RMC is a React UI kit built on the latest version (v13) of Google's official [Material Components Web](https://material.io/components/web) library

Features:

* [x] Uses Google's official [`material-components-web`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) library
* [x] Supports React v16, v17, and up (unlike [RMWC](https://github.com/jamesmfriedman/rmwc) which only supports v16)
* [x] First class Typescript support
* [x] Server side rendering support
* [x] Individually packaged and released components

## Goals

* To create the thinnest, lightest, and spec compliant wrapper around Google's [Material Components Web](https://material.io/components/web)
* To utilize the foundation JavaScript classes from [`material-components-web`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
* To be as unobtrusive and sensible as possible
* To actually stay up-to-date with Google's [releases](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/releases) (unlike [RMWC](https://github.com/jamesmfriedman/rmwc) which still uses v5)
